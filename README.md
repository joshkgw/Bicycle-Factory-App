The Greener-Bikes Bicycle Factory App will facilitate the production process of bicycles by tracking
inventory, managing assembly stations, and recording customer orders. This application will help
streamline the manufacturing process, allowing employees to efficiently manage resources and
respond to customer demands.

The program currently does not meet the full specification - personally, this was a very challenging project - but I am very happy with where it is at.
